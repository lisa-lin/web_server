## Web Server and Browser (from the command line)
This is a very simple command line browser, you can issue GET and POST request and see the HTTP response of those requests.
To run it you need to have two terminals opened, in the first one run `$ ruby server.rb` to start the web server, and in the second
one run `$ ruby browser.rb` to start the browser.
